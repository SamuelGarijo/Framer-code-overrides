# Dynamic Styling and Responsive Design in Framer Overrides

This document covers advanced techniques for implementing dynamic styling and responsive design in Framer overrides, focusing on breakpoint-responsive code, dynamic styling, and layout management.

## Breakpoint-Responsive Overrides

Breakpoint-responsive overrides allow your Framer prototypes to adapt to different screen sizes. Here's an enhanced example of a breakpoint-responsive override:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { Override } from "framer"

function getBreakpoint(width: number): "mobile" | "tablet" | "desktop" {
    if (width < 768) return "mobile"
    if (width < 1024) return "tablet"
    return "desktop"
}

export function ResponsiveOverride(): Override {
    const [breakpoint, setBreakpoint] = useState(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth))

    useEffect(() => {
        const handleResize = () => {
            setBreakpoint(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth))
        }

        window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize)
        return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize)
    }, [])

    return {
        variant: breakpoint,
        animate: { opacity: breakpoint === "mobile" ? 0.8 : 1 },
        transition: { duration: 0.3 },
    }
}
```

This override not only changes the variant based on the breakpoint but also applies different styles (in this case, opacity) for different screen sizes.

## Dynamic Styling

Dynamic styling allows you to change the appearance of components based on various conditions or states. Here's an example of a dynamic styling override:

```typescript
import { useState } from "react"
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

export function withDynamicStyling(Component): ComponentType {
    return (props) => {
        const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false)
        const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false)

        const dynamicStyle = {
            backgroundColor: isActive ? "#ff0000" : isHovered ? "#00ff00" : "#0000ff",
            scale: isActive ? 1.1 : isHovered ? 1.05 : 1,
            boxShadow: isActive
                ? "0px 5px 15px rgba(0,0,0,0.3)"
                : isHovered
                ? "0px 3px 10px rgba(0,0,0,0.2)"
                : "none",
        }

        return (
            <motion.div
                animate={dynamicStyle}
                onHoverStart={() => setIsHovered(true)}
                onHoverEnd={() => setIsHovered(false)}
                onTapStart={() => setIsActive(true)}
                onTapEnd={() => setIsActive(false)}
            >
                <Component {...props} />
            </motion.div>
        )
    }
}
```

This override applies different styles based on the hover and active states of the component, creating a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## Layout Management

Effective layout management is crucial for creating responsive designs. Here's an example of a layout management override that adjusts the layout based on the breakpoint:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

const layouts = {
    mobile: { flexDirection: "column", alignItems: "center" },
    tablet: { flexDirection: "row", flexWrap: "wrap", justifyContent: "center" },
    desktop: { flexDirection: "row", justifyContent: "space-between" },
}

export function withResponsiveLayout(Component): ComponentType {
    return (props) => {
        const [breakpoint, setBreakpoint] = useState(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth))

        useEffect(() => {
            const handleResize = () => setBreakpoint(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth))
            window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize)
            return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize)
        }, [])

        return (
            <motion.div
                style={{
                    display: "flex",
                    width: "100%",
                    ...layouts[breakpoint],
                }}
                animate={layouts[breakpoint]}
                transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
            >
                <Component {...props} />
            </motion.div>
        )
    }
}
```

This override adjusts the layout of child components based on the current breakpoint, ensuring that the design remains responsive across different screen sizes.

## Combining Techniques

For the most effective responsive design, you can combine these techniques. Here's an example that incorporates breakpoint detection, dynamic styling, and layout management:

```typescript
import { useEffect, useState } from "react"
import { motion } from "framer-motion"

export function withResponsiveDesign(Component): ComponentType {
    return (props) => {
        const [breakpoint, setBreakpoint] = useState(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth))
        const [isHovered, setIsHovered] = useState(false)

        useEffect(() => {
            const handleResize = () => setBreakpoint(getBreakpoint(window.innerWidth))
            window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize)
            return () => window.removeEventListener("resize", handleResize)
        }, [])

        const dynamicStyle = {
            fontSize: breakpoint === "mobile" ? "14px" : "16px",
            padding: breakpoint === "mobile" ? "10px" : "20px",
            backgroundColor: isHovered ? "#f0f0f0" : "#ffffff",
        }

        const layoutStyle = {
            display: "flex",
            flexDirection: breakpoint === "mobile" ? "column" : "row",
            alignItems: breakpoint === "mobile" ? "center" : "flex-start",
        }

        return (
            <motion.div
                style={layoutStyle}
                animate={dynamicStyle}
                onHoverStart={() => setIsHovered(true)}
                onHoverEnd={() => setIsHovered(false)}
            >
                <Component {...props} />
            </motion.div>
        )
    }
}
```

This comprehensive override combines breakpoint detection for responsive layouts, dynamic styling based on hover state, and adaptive typography and spacing. It demonstrates how these techniques can work together to create a fully responsive and dynamic design in Framer.

By mastering these techniques, you can create Framer prototypes that are not only responsive to different screen sizes but also dynamically adapt their styling and layout for an optimal user experience across devices.
