# Implementing Truncated Text in Framer with Overrides

## Overview

Using code overrides is the most effective way to implement text truncation in Framer. This approach offers simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration with existing designs.

## Key Benefits of Using Overrides for Text Truncation

1. **Simplicity**: Modify existing components without creating new ones.
2. **Flexibility**: Apply truncation to any text layer in your project.
3. **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly incorporate into your existing designs.
4. **User-Friendly**: Accessible to designers with limited coding experience.

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Create the Override File

Create a new file in your Framer project (e.g., `TruncateTextOverride.ts`) and add the following code:

```typescript
import type { ComponentType } from "react"

// Define the number of lines after which to truncate
const LINES = 4

export default function withLineTruncate(Component): ComponentType {
    return (props) => {
        const styles = {
            ...props?.style,
            WebkitLineClamp: `${LINES}`,
            WebkitBoxOrient: "vertical",
            textOverflow: "ellipsis",
            display: "-webkit-box",
            overflow: "hidden",
        }
        return (
            <>
                <Component {...props} style={styles} />
            </>
        )
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Apply the Override

1. In Framer, select the text layer you want to truncate.
2. In the properties panel, find the "Overrides" section.
3. Click on "Add Override" and select your `TruncateTextOverride` file.

### Step 3: Customize (Optional)

- Adjust the `LINES` constant in the override file to change the number of lines displayed before truncation.
- Modify the `styles` object to add additional styling if needed.

## Best Practices

1. **Use Constants**: Define the number of lines as a constant for easy adjustment.
2. **Preserve Existing Styles**: Use the spread operator (`...props?.style`) to maintain any existing styles on the component.
3. **Keep It Simple**: The override should focus solely on truncation, leaving other styling concerns to Framer's built-in tools.

## Considerations

- Ensure the text layer has a fixed height for the truncation to work correctly.
- The height of your layer defines how many lines will be shown. You can calculate this using:
  ```
  height = (fontSize * lineHeight) * numberOfLines
  ```

## Conclusion

By using this override approach, you can easily implement text truncation in Framer without the need for complex custom components. This method provides a balance of functionality and simplicity, making it ideal for most Framer projects.
