## Component Documentation Guide

Based on our interactions, here is a guide for an AI on how to create component documentation according to your preferences:

### 1. Layered Structure:
- Divide the documentation into separate files for each main layer of the component.
- Use the HTML hierarchy as a guide for the file structure.

### 2. Naming Conventions:
- Use HTML class names or IDs to name the files and sections.

### 3. Layout Details:
- Specify the type of layout (Flex, Grid, etc.)
- Include all layout properties: `direction`, `wrap`, `justify-content`, `align-items`, `align-content`, `gap`.

### 4. Dimensions and Sizes:
- Provide detailed information on `width` and `height`.
- Include specific units (px, %, fr, etc.)
- Mention minimum and maximum values (`min-width`, `max-width`, etc.)
- Indicate if there are fixed aspect ratios (use terms like "Aspect Ratio Locked").

### 5. Positioning:
- Specify the type of positioning (`relative`, `absolute`, etc.)
- For absolute positioning, include values for `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`.

### 6. Layer Styles:
- Mention properties like `overflow`, `z-index`, `opacity`.
- Include border styles, including color and style.
- Specify background colors and gradients if present.
- Detail `border-radius`.

### 7. Text Elements:
- Describe the layout and dimensions of the text container.
- Include information on wrapping, overflow, and truncation.
- Do NOT include specific typographic styles.

### 8. Responsive Design:
- If there are responsive variants, document them in a subsection of the relevant component.
- Highlight changes in layout, sizes, and styles for different breakpoints.

### 9. Interactivity:
- Mention interactive states (`hover`, `active`, etc.) if present in the CSS.

### 10. Precision and Thoroughness:
- Be as precise as possible with values.
- Do not omit details, even if they seem minor.
- If a property is not defined or uses a default value, explicitly indicate it.

### 11. Formatting:
- Use a consistent and easy-to-read format.
- Group related properties.
- Use indentation to show hierarchy and relationships between elements.

### 12. Context:
- If relevant, provide brief context on the function or purpose of the component or element.

Remember, the key is to be exhaustive, precise, and structured, providing all the information necessary to recreate the component exactly as designed, without omitting any crucial details regarding layout or style.
