Let me summarize my understanding:

The project has a section called "SED CONTRA" with an H3 in a sticky position (8vh from the top).
Below that, there's a frame named "Collection Grid" using horizontal stacks with wrap, containing 10 containers (ItemSpace X) each with a minimum width of 40%.
Each container has a collection list connected to the same CMS, but limited to show only one item each (Collection List - 1, Collection List - 2, etc.).
The items in these collections have been converted into components called "collectionItem".
There are 10 override files (CollItem1.tsx to CollItem10.tsx) corresponding to each item in the "Collection Grid". We're looking at CollItem1.tsx as an example.
The shared state is managed in sharedStore.ts, which creates a store with information about all items, breakpoints, and other global states.
The main functionalities implemented in the overrides are:

withExpandableItem: Applied to ItemSpace X, handles the expansion of the item.
withToggleExpandButton: Applied to a button inside the "collectionItem" component, toggles the expansion state.
withVariantChange: Applied to the "collectionItem" component, changes the variant based on the expansion state and breakpoint.


There's a separate ResetButton.tsx that provides functionality to reset all items to their initial state.
The overrides use a combination of React hooks (useState, useEffect, useCallback) and the shared store to manage state and side effects.
The system takes into account responsive design, with different behaviors for mobile and desktop breakpoints.
When an item is expanded, it changes to span the full width, becomes sticky at the top (with an offset), and may change its height and background color.
The system ensures that only one item can be expanded at a time, collapsing others when a new item is expanded.
There's functionality to scroll to the expanded item or the last expanded item when resetting.

This setup allows for a dynamic and interactive grid of items that can expand and collapse, with smooth transitions and scrolling behaviors, all while maintaining a responsive design.

Shared Store (sharedStore.ts):

The shared store is the central state management system for the entire application. It uses Framer's createStore function to create a global state.
Key aspects of the store:

It maintains the state for all 10 items, including their mode (span 1 or span 2), variant (close/mob, open/mob, or open/dsk), whether they've been opened, and their background color.
It keeps track of the current breakpoint (mobile, tablet, or desktop).
It stores the last expanded item and whether any item is currently expanded.
It has a globalForceVisible flag and an expandedBackgroundColor.

Key functions in sharedStore.ts:

expandItemAndCollapseOthers: This function is crucial. When an item is expanded, it collapses all other items and updates the state of the expanded item.
markItemAsOpened: Marks an item as having been opened.
updateBreakpoint: Updates the breakpoint based on the window width.
toggleGlobalVisibility: Toggles the globalForceVisible flag.
scrollToLastExpandedItem: Handles scrolling to the last expanded item.


CollItem1.tsx (and likely CollItem2.tsx through CollItem10.tsx):

This file contains the main logic for each expandable item.
Key functions and hooks:

useItemState: A custom hook that manages the state for a specific item. It:

Retrieves the item's state from the shared store.
Manages the topOffset state for sticky positioning.
Provides a toggleExpand function to expand/collapse the item.
Listens for window resize events to update the breakpoint and topOffset.


withExpandableItem: This override applies the expandable behavior to the item. It:

Applies dynamic styles based on the item's expanded state.
Handles the sticky positioning when expanded.
Manages the transition effects.


withToggleExpandButton: This override is applied to the expand/collapse button. It:

Toggles the item's expanded state.
Triggers scrolling to the item when expanded.


withVariantChange: This override manages the item's variant based on its state and the current breakpoint.
withScrollToElement: A utility override that can be used to scroll to a specific element.


ResetButton.tsx:

This file contains the logic for resetting all items to their initial state.
Key function:

withResetAllItems: This override:

Resets all items to their initial collapsed state.
Preserves the 'hasBeenOpened' state for each item.
Triggers scrolling to the last expanded item before reset.




Interaction Flow:


When a user clicks on an item's expand button:

The withToggleExpandButton override triggers.
It calls the toggleExpand function from useItemState.
toggleExpand updates the shared store using expandItemAndCollapseOthers.
This update causes all items to re-render:

The expanded item changes its style and variant.
All other items collapse if they were expanded.


The expanded item scrolls into view.


When the window resizes:

The resize listener in useItemState triggers.
It updates the topOffset for sticky positioning.
It updates the breakpoint in the shared store.
This may cause items to change their variant (e.g., from open/mob to open/dsk).


When the reset button is clicked:

The withResetAllItems override triggers.
It resets all items in the shared store to their initial state.
It triggers a scroll to the last expanded item.




Responsive Behavior:

The system handles responsiveness through:

Breakpoint detection and storage in the shared store.
Different variants for mobile and desktop views (open/mob vs open/dsk).
Adjusting styles and behaviors based on the current breakpoint.

This system creates a highly interactive and responsive grid of items that can expand and collapse smoothly, with only one item expanded at a time. The use of a shared store ensures consistent state across all items, while individual overrides allow for specific behaviors to be applied to different components within the Framer canvas.
