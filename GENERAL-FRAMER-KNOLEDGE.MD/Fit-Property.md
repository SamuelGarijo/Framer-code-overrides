Simply create a Text Layer, head over to the Size property and set it to Fit. You can also use Fit Text on multiple lines of text, which you can create by hitting enter when you want your line to break. Define minimum and maximum font sizes by using the Min Width and Max Width properties. This can be done on the Text Layer itself, or any parent layer. Best of all, this feature keeps your sites blazing fast. Framer can render your typography at the right size even before JavaScript runs on your website. No flashes on refresh, and no expensive calculations on resize. We think youâ€™ll love it.
